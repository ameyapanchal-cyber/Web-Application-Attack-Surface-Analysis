# Web-Application-Attack-Surface-Analysis
# Web Pentesting Fundamentals

This repository documents my structured learning of web application fundamentals from a penetration tester’s perspective.

The focus of this repository is to understand how web applications work internally, how servers and browsers communicate, and how attackers analyze websites to identify attack surfaces before exploitation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand HTTP communication between client and server
- Analyze HTTP status codes and their behavior
- Learn web application structure, files, and folders
- Identify parameters and understand their role in application logic
- Build the attacker mindset for web enumeration and analysis

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- HTTP request and response flow
- HTTP methods and headers
- HTTP status codes and server behavior
- Web technologies and application structure
- Important web files and directories
- Parameters and application logic
- Attack surface identification (theory-focused)

> Note: This repository focuses on **understanding and observation**, not exploitation.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Browser Developer Tools
- Course-based demonstrations
- Conceptual analysis of requests and responses

(Burp Suite and advanced tooling will be added after formal instruction.)
